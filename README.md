# IMIEverify
Just a Python 3 script to identify if an IMEI is valid, and if it isn't it will show possible single digit transcriptiosn that work (to quickly find out that you transcribed a 3 as an 8 or something crazy like that)

I made this as a personal project to practice Python. If you are visiting and have a critique I am happy to receive it.
